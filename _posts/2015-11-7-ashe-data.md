Comments on Data Science in Higher Education
============================================

What is Data Science? Some people say that Data Science is statistics, but done on a Mac. I do think that Data Science as a practice enacts several principles that we in higher education resrarch should do much more to emulate. Today I'll emphasize three:

* Displays of data analysis that reflect the complexity of modern computing and displays
* Showing results of data analysis that are dynamnic and not static
* Being transparent about process used for results

Complex Displays
----------------

In presenting our research we use exactly the same style of presentation of our data that was used in 50 years ago. The innovators in the 1960s and 1970s who first used punch-cards to do data analysis in the social sciences reported their results in static tables, with maybe some graphics. Fifty years later, when computing power, storage and the graphical displays have all improved by multiple orders of magintude and we have gained the ability to communicate results at never-before-seen levels of resuolutuion, we report static tables, with maybe some graphics. It's not acceptable. Data displays should be rich, showing all of the data in a graphical format that aids in understanding.


Dynamic Reporting of Results
----------------
Every analyst knows that they have made decisions along the way that could affect the results of their analysis. Yet in our reporting of results, we pretend as if those decisions don't exist. The tools exist to allow the end-user to make different choices about the analysis that could affect the results. Reporting of results should be dynamic, such that the end user can undertand the relationships in the data. This step is unnerving because the author becomes a guide to the relationships in the data observed, not the final arbiter of the precise "right" way to undertake the analysis.

Transparency
------------
Most analysis in higher education research takes place behind a curtain. The analyst or analysts write their code, undertake their analysis, and then report the results. There's no ability for others to track the decisions made along the way or to understand the way in which the analyst arrived at their results. Transparency as researchers ought to be our goal. Two ways to help achieve transparency:

* Use an open-source programming language. The two dominant languages in Data Science are Python and R, for good reason.
* Use a version control system such as Git or SVN. These are low-cost, easy to access, and allow for a workflow that tracks how the analysis might change over time.
* Share your code and data using the above tools.
