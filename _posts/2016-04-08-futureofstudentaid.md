Notes from New American "Starting from Scratch" session 4/8/2016

Resolved: "Any additional federal dollars for higher education should go directly to states or institutions rather than to student aid."

My notes, arguing the affirmative: 

Assumptions that underlie our current system
-------

Our national system for making college affordable is based on a set of assumptions that no longer hold. In the early 1970s, when the system was created, the following set of assumptions formed the basis for our national system:

The federal government would provide need-based financial aid, directly to students.

States and institutions would work together to keep tuition at public institutions low. The states would do this through appropriations, institutions would do this by using that money efficiently.

State financial aid would be need-based, and focused in large part on encouraging student choice.

Institutions (public and private), if they charged a lot more than the financial aid programs covered, would make sure that any student they admitted could afford to attend-- they would practice need-blind admissions and need-based financial aid.


While the federal government has kept its part of the bargain, states and institutions have drifted away from their original commitments. 

Federal government
-------------------
The federal government has increased its commitment to need-based financial aid over time, with substantial increases over the last two presidential administrations. These increases can be seen in the average amount aid that students receive. Looking at data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey, Pell grant aid for low income students at public four year institutions has increased from $1,900 to $3,300 between 1996 and 2012-- a 74 percent increase. 


States, institutions, and low tuition
-------------------
As states have been spending less on higher education tuition has gone up. Tuition at public four-year institutions increased by [80 percent from 2000-2015 in inflation adjusted terms](http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-and-fees-and-room-and-board-over-time-1975-76-2015-16-selected-years). 


State financial aid
---------------------
These increases in tuition might not have been painful for low-income students, if they had been covered by increases in state student financial aid. State financial aid for low-income students at public institutions didn't budge in inflation adjusted terms between 1996 and 2012. In contrast, state financial aid for high income students increased more than 450 percent in inflation adjusted terms from 1996 to its high point. 

Institutional aid
-------
Institutional aid is the largest form of financial aid and the last resort for students to attend. For many institutions, there has been a profound shift in [how they award financial aid](https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/undermining-pell-volume-iii/). Again looking at data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey and focusing on private institutions, institutional aid for low-income students at private institutions did increase from 1996 to 2012, from $3,000 to $7,700, a 157 percent increase, for which the institutions deserve credit. Average aid for high-income students at these same institutions increased from $1,950 to $6,400, a 230 percent increase.

Drifting away
---------

The data unambiguously show that states and institutions are drifting from their original commitments, while the federal government has kept up its part of the bargain.

I don't believe that states and institutions will return to their commitments until they are given very incentive to do so. In particular, I am convinced that federal financial aid needs to be restructured so that the states and institutions must prioritize affordability (and therefore access) for low-income students, ideas that I explore in more detail [here](https://www.ced.org/reports/single/a-new-partnership-the-road-to-reshaping-federal-state-financial-aid).
