Hi All-

I'm looking forward to our class this semester in Data Science. This will be a challenging but fun class-- I hope to provide you with skills that will be valuable to you in your future careers. 

Before class on Wednesday, I have a few things I'd like for you to do.

1. Check out the syllabus: this is still under construction (and will continue to be throughout the semester) but it gives you a sense of what we'll be up to. Syllabus is here: [https://github.com/hoddatascifall16/central/blob/master/syllabus.md](https://github.com/hoddatascifall16/central/blob/master/syllabus.md)

2. Download the software we'll need for class. All of the software is free. 

   - You will need R, an open-source data analysis software environment. Available here: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

   - You will need Rstudio, an Integrated Development Environment for R. Available here-- you need the free Desktop version: [https://www.rstudio.com/home/](https://www.rstudio.com/home/)

   - You will need git, a version control program. It's availabe here:     [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downlo  ads)

3. Get a free account on github. Github will be where all class materials will be hosted and where you will turn in all assignments and project files. 

This is very simple, just go here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account. Please email me your account name as soon as you've got one. You will be added to the organization for this class. Please have this done prior to the first day of class. 

4. You'll notice there's one book you have to buy for this class, [Nate Silver's Signal and the Noise](https://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail--but/dp/0143125087/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472150752&sr=8-1&keywords=signal+and+the+noise+paperback). You can find this book in many places. It's a fun read. I expect that you will have read it by September 5.
