Welcome to Data Science!
========================

Today, we'll be working on getting you set up with the tools you will
need for this class. Once you are set up, we'll do what we're here to
do: analyze data!

Here's what we need to get done today:

1.  Introductions  
2.  Installing R
3.  Installing Rstudio
4.  Installing git
5.  Getting set up on GitHub
6.  Initializing everyone's github repos
7.  hello\_world.Rmd

Introductions
-------------

Installing R
------------

R is going to be the only programming language we will use. R is an
extensible statistical programming environment that can handle all of
the main tasks that we'll need to cover this semester: getting data,
analyzing data and communicating data analysis.

If you haven't already, you need to download R here:
<https://cran.r-project.org/>.

Installing Rstudio
------------------

When we work with R, we communicate via the command line. To help
automate this process, we can write scripts, which contain all of the
commands to be executed. These scripts generate various kinds of output,
like numbers on the screen, graphics or reports in common formats (pdf,
word). Most programming languages have several \_I\_ntegrated
\_D\_evelopment \_E\_nvironments (IDEs) that encompass all of these
elements (scripts, command line interface, output). The primary IDE for
R is Rstudio.

If you haven't already, you need to download Rstudio here:
<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/>. You need the free
Rstudio desktop version.

Installing git
--------------

git is a version control program. A standard problem in programming is
how to track the changes that have been made to a project. These
challenges are well-known to anyone who has had to work on a complex
document, particularly with collaborators. Because these problems are
particularly severe in programming, they developed a set of tools called
version control. These will keep track of every change you make to a
file, and record why you made the change.

If you haven't already, you need to download git here:

Getting set up on GitHub
------------------------

GitHub is online hosting service that is widely used by programmers. It
allows you to easily share your work with the world. It is integrated
with git, so version control is easy to do.

Initializing repos
------------------

Everyone in the class will need a repository (repo from now on) on our
GitHub organization. All I need from you is your username on GitHub,
then I can add your repo to our organization.

To integrate Rstudio with GitHub, you need to enable git as your version
control within Rstudio.

Instructions are
[here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN).

Cloning down your repo
----------------------

From RStudio, you'll need to click New Project--&gt;Version
Control--&gt;GitHub--&gt;Then find your repo, which will be here
`https://github.com/hoddatascifall16/student_<yourlastname>`

*N.B. in this class, and generally in programming, when you see*
`<text>` *that means that you need to substitute something in.*

Name the project using your last name. This project will be the only
place you need to work for this class the entire semester.

Yes We Code! Running R Code
---------------------------

The following code chunk will be our first use of R in this class. We're
going to grab some data that's part of the [college
scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/) and do a
bit of analysis on it.

You can download the data [here](../files/college.Rdata)

![](./files/scorecard-1.png)

Here are the variables in the `college.Rdata` dataset:

*Variable Name* :*Definition* unitid: Unit ID

instnm: Institution Name

stabbr: State Abbreviation

year: Year

adm\_rate: Proportion of Applicants Admitted

sat\_avg: Midpoint of entrance exam scores, on SAT scale, math and
verbal only

costt4a: Average cost of attendance (tuition and room and board less all
grant aid)

debt\_mdn: Median debt of graduates

md\_earn\_ne\_pg: Earnings of graduates who are not enrolled in higher
education, six years after graduation

Your first commit: hello\_world.Rmd
-----------------------------------

.Rmd files will be the only file format we work in this class. .Rmd
files contain three basic elements:

1.  Script that can be interpreted by R.
2.  Output generated by R, including tables and figures.  
3.  Text that can be read by humans.

From a .Rmd file you can generate html documents, pdf documents, word
documents, slides . . . lots of stuff. All class notes will be in .Rmd.
All assignments will be turned in as .Rmd files, and your final project?
You guessed it, .Rmd.

For today, I want you to create a file called
`hello_world_<lastname>.Rmd` in your github repo for assignment 1. It
should contain the following elements:

1.  A sentence that says "Hello, World"
2.  R output that summarizes one of the variables in the
    `colllege.Rdata` dataset
3.  R output that shows a scatterplot for two of the variables in the
    `college.Rdata` dataset.

Lucky for you this is is also your first assignment! Submit it under
assignment 1, using the format `assignment1_<lastname>.Rmd`. All
assignments should be turned in using this format.

*Stretch Items*

If you have extra time, you can do the following:

1.  Calculate the average earnings for individuals at the most selective
    colleges, then compare that with individuals at the least selective
    colleges in the dataset.
2.  Find a way to determine whether colleges with very high SAT scores
    tend to be larger or smaller than colleges with low SAT scores.
3.  Plot the relationship between cost and debt. What do you see? Does
    this surprise you?
4.  Now, provide separate plots for cost and debt by control of
    the institution.
